Program 1 : Demonstration of class.
		A class is defined as template or model for an object. A class is collection
	     of varibles and functions. An object is defined as an instance of the class.
	     class is a reserved word. When we define a class, no memory is allocated to
	     the class.

Program 2 :      Write a C++ program for a triangle class. It contains 3 sides of a
	    triangle, functions like getdata() for accepting the 3 sides, test() function to 
	    test whether the 3 sides forms a triangle or not, area() function to find area, 
	    perimeter() function to find perimeter.

Program 3 : Assignment
		Write a C++ program for a rectangle class. It contains length, breadth,
	    getdata(), area(), perimeter().

Program 4 : Assignment
	         Write a C++ Program for student class. It contains roll no., student name, marks             of 3 subjects, total, average, grade. Functions like getdata(),compute(),putdata().

Program 5 : Assignment
	         Write a C++ program for an employee class. It contains employee
	    number, employee name, salary, city, gross pay, net pay. Functions
	    like getdata(), compute(), putdata().

 Program 6 : Assignment
		 Write a C++ program for a complex number class. It contains real
	     part, imaginary part, getdata(), putdata(), add(), sub(), mul(), div().

Program 7 : Assignment
		Write a C++ program for a rational number class. It contains 
	    numerator, denominator, getdata(), putdata(), add(), sub(), mul(), div() 

Program 8 :	Write a C++ program for a stack class. It contains :
	     Array s, variable top, push(), pop(), display(), initialize().
		     Note : stack is nothing but LIFO(Last In First Out).
	   When the stack is empty, top = -1
	   When the stack is full, top = size-1
	   When top < (size-1), the stack is not full, insertion is possible. Both 					insertion and deletion is possible only from top.

Program 9 : Write a C++ program for a generic stack class.

Program 10 : Write a C Program to implement the integer stack through linked lists. 
	     Note: Stacks
		   A Stack is a data structure in which data is organised in a LIFO form.
		LIFO means Last In First Out. Stacks have the same entry and exit points.
		push : The process of storing the data into the stack is called push.
		pop : The process of retrieving the data from the stack is called pop.

			A stack has a pointer called stack pointer which always points to the top 		most element of the stack. Stacks are used by the operating system to allocate 				memory for local variables.

Program 11 :	Write a C++ program for a queue class. It contains :
		     Array s, variables F, R,  insert(), del(), display(), initialize().
		Note : Queue is nothing but FIFO(First In First Out).
			F contains the position/index of the first element inserted.
			R contains the position/index of the last element inserted.
				In Queues, insertion is from rear end i.e., RHS and deletion is
			from front end i.e., LHS.
		For insertion, do R++ . For deletion, do F++ .
		Condition for Queue empty is : R = -1.
		Whenever R = (size-1), Queue is full and insertion is not possible.
		When ther is only one element in the queue (F==R), to delete that
		element, do not perform F++. Instead reinitialize F=0 and R=-1.
			For implementing stacks, we require one Array, one variable.
			For implementing queues, we require one Array, two variables.
		Note : Stack insertion and Queue insertion methods are same whereas 
			Stack Deletion and Queue Deletion methods are different.

Program 12 : Write a C++ program for a generic queue class.
	Note: 
	1. If the member functions are defined outside the generic class, then
		before each member function, we should write
		template<class T>.
		This is not required if the member functions are defined within
		the generic class.
	2. The generic queue class name is queue<T>. If it is normal classs, class
		name is queue.
	3. In Generic function, atleast one formal parameter must be of type T. In
		Generic class, atleast one class variable must be generic type T.
	4. Generic functions should be preceded by 
		template<class T>.
			There are two rules for generic functions.
			(1). It must be written before the calling function i.e. main();
			(2). It can not have prototypes.


Program 13 : Write a C Program to implement queues through linked lists.
		Note: Queues 
			Queue is a data structure in which data is arranged in FIFO manner.
		FIFO means First In First Out. Queues have a separate entry point and exit 				points. Queues are used by the operating systems to schedule the tasks that are 			to be submitted to the CPU.

Program 14 : Write a C++ program to implement the Linked List.

Program 15 : Write a C++ Program to implement the Generic Linked List.
