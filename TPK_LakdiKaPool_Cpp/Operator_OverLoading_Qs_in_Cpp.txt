		Introduction to Operator Overloading
		------------------------------------
	In C++, all the operators are defined wrt variables. No operator is defined wrt
arrays, structures, objects(except = operator).
	Operator overloading allows us to define operators wrt objects but not for arrays
and structures.
	Operator Overloading is nothing but assigning one more meaning for all the operators 
wrt objects. After overloading, the existing meaning is not lost i.e., if we overload
+ operator wrt objects, variable + variable is valid and also object + object is also
valid.
	Every operator can be overloaded in C++ except four operators. They are:
		1. Conditional operator/Ternary operator ? :
		2. Scope Resolution Operator ::
		3. sizeof operator
		4. Member access parameter .,*
	Each operator can be overloaded as member function or non-member function.

Operator			Member Function		Non-Member Function/Friend Function
--------			---------------		-----------------------------------
1. Binary Operators		1 parameter				2 parameters
	+,-,*,/,%,<,> etc
2. Unary Operators		0 parameter				1 parameter
	++,--,-
3.	<< , >>			-					2 parameters
4. new, delete, [],		1 parameter 				We can't write these 
(), =, += etc							functions as friend functions

			We can not implement << , >> as member functions since they are already
defined as member functions in istream and ostream classes resply.
			Binary operators(+,-,*,/,% etc) can be implemented as member function or
non-member function(friend function).
			=, +=, new, delete, [], () must be overloaded as member functions only
but not as friend functions.
	a = b;	equivalent to a.operator =(b) where a is owner object, b is parameter object
	a += =b;		a.operator +=(b);
	a[2];			a.operator [](2);
	new classname;		operator new(classname);
	delete p;		operator delete(p);
	(i,l);			operator ()(i,l);


Program 2: Overload +, -, *, /, <<, >> operators on complex number object.
